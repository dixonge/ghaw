OK, let's be honest. There isn't much of a legend. The nickname basically came out of some friendly banter with the workers at our favorite watering hole down here in ol' Mexico. I'm a lifelong Texan (tejano in Spanish) and someone mentioned coyote and I combined them into one nonsensical word. It's been my nickname there ever since.

I'm experimenting with this whole 'put your blog on GitHub' thing. I'm currently using the static site generator Jekyll and the GitHub Windows client.

So we'll see how this goes, I guess.
