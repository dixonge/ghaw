Recently oDesk and Elance began completing their merger. The new site is called [Upwork](http://upwork.com).

As can be expected, there are glitches and resets. The first thing that caught my attention was when my email inbox started receiving a *LOT* more email notifications than usual. So of course I logged in to Upwork and went to the notifications page.

Sure enough, every single possible notification was turned on. So naturally I attempted to customize these to my preferences, and that's when the problems occurred. When I attempted to save the settings, a white, opaque window popped up with an animated spinning icon. The spinning never stopped, the settings never saved. When I reloaded the page all boxes were still checked.

So I tried logging into the site using a browser I had never used on this new Upwork site before, Internet Explorer. Same result. This led me to opening a support ticket, mainly to let them know that there was a problem to be fixed.

In response, I got a canned email talking about browser caches and cookies. On top of that, the ticket was closed with a presumption of being resolved!

I also tweeted a link to this blog post, and in fairly short order the @UpworkHelp account responded with an actual, official explanation of the problem. No, it wasn't me - it is a known issue being worked on by their engineers. It's been an issue since the switchover. This matches what I had suspected, but it doesn't give me any greater confidence in their support procedures. I'm now *less* worried about the future viability of this company, but my confidence in my ability to get timely, actually helpful support is still pretty low...
